EMScript:
* Meant to be easily called and interpreted from a parenting program which defines the external methods the programmer can use (for applications such as games with scripting)
* Explicit mutability (like Rust) and well-defined reference vs. value (also like Rust)
* Relatively performant
* Structs/traits (like Rust). Probably also generics, down the road

Maybe:
* Garbage Collection
* Async/multi-threading
